abstract: Many designs have been proposed to improve the sensitivity of ion mobility
  spectrometry (IMS) by modifying its electric field in recent years. However, most
  of them have shown severe differences between the theoretical predictions and the
  experimental results. In this work, the effect of electric field on the drifting
  process was studied from the perspective of spatial ion density. Theoretical derivation
  illustrated that the nonuniform electric field has no direct influence on the spatial
  ion density in free space, and the mean spatial ion density was difficult to increase
  but easy to decrease when crossing grids. Therefore, to improve the sensitivity,
  a denser ion swarm should be produced in the reaction zone and dilution should be
  prevented when crossing the ion shutter. Based on this principle, an optimized design
  was proposed to improve the sensitivity of IMS equipping a UV radiation ionization
  source. A denser ion swarm was produced by reducing the electric field strength
  of the reaction zone, and a tri-grid ion shutter was adopted to realize the anti-dilution
  function. Experimental results showed an impressive improvement, and the SNR of
  dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) dimer peak increased by 22.6 times without any
  loss in the resolving power.
