abstract: Segmentation of the shank gastrocnemius (Gas) and soleus (Sol) muscles in
  ultrasound (US) images allows to extract the muscle features, which are important
  for the early diagnosis of muscle atrophy. The automatic segmentation of the muscles
  is a challenging task, and deep learning (DL) provides a solution to this problem,
  which can effectively extract representative features from the muscle regions and
  background of the images. In this study, we propose ResTU-net, an automatic segmentation
  method based on improved U-net network, to segment the Gas and Sol muscles in shank
  US images. This network uses the deep residual neural network (Resnet) as the sublayer
  unit of each layer of a U-net, and can effectively combine the features of each
  layer with those of the next layer to meet the challenges of poor US image quality
  and low contrast. In addition, dilated convolution is used instead of the pooling
  layer in the network to prevent information loss during training. Experiments were
  performed on 3350 shank US images from 23 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, among them,
  2650 shank US images were used for network training and 700 for network validation.
  Compared with state-of-the-art networks, the experimental results show that the
  method can achieved the best segmentation capability results and a mean Dice similarity
  coefficient (DSC) of the Gas and Sol muscles of 94.82% and 90.72%, respectively.
  This work indicates that the proposed fully automatic segmentation method may be
  accurately and efficiently applied to Gas and Sol muscles segmentation in shank
  US images.
