abstract: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used to explore
  the causal relationship between specific brain regions and task switching. However,
  most studies have focused on the frontal cortex, and only few have examined other
  related cortices, e.g., the parietal cortex. So far, no prior study has systematically
  explored the tDCS-induced effect of the parietal cortex in different task switching
  types. Therefore, the current study mainly used the unilateral anodal-tDCS (a-tDCS)
  stimulation setting to investigate the possible involvement of the parietal cortex
  in predictable and unpredictable task switching. It was noted that compared with
  sham group, significantly higher switch cost reaction time of right anode tDCS (RA)
  group was found in predictable task but not unpredictable task. No interaction effect
  was observed between congruence and tDCS groups in predictable task. These findings
  suggested that a-tDCS over right parietal cortex could markedly decrease the predictable
  task-switching performance in both congruent and incongruent trials, and indicated
  that parietal cortex is more likely to be involved in the proactive cognitive processes,
  such as endogenous preparation.
