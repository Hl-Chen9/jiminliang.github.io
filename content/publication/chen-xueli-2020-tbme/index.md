abstract: 'Objective: Stimulated Raman projection tomography (SRPT), a recently developed
  label-free volumetric chemical imaging technology, has been reported to quantitatively
  reconstruct the distribution of chemicals in a three-dimensional (3D) complex system.
  The current image reconstruction scheme used in SRPT is based on a filtered back
  projection (FBP) algorithm that requires at least 180 angular-dependent projections
  to rebuild a reasonable SRPT image, resulting in a long total acquisition time.
  This is a big limitation for longitudinal studies on live systems. Methods: We present
  a sparse-view data-based sparse reconstruction scheme, in which sparsely sampled
  projections at 180 degrees were used to reconstruct the volumetric information.
  In the scheme, the simultaneous algebra reconstruction technique (SART), combined
  with total variation regularization, was used for iterative reconstruction. To better
  describe the projection process, a pixel vertex driven model (PVDM) was developed
  to act as projectors, whose performance was compared with those of the distance
  driven model (DDM). Results: We evaluated our scheme with numerical simulations
  and validated it for SRPT by mapping lipid contents in adipose cells. Simulation
  results showed that the PVDM performed better than the DDM in the case of using
  sparse-view data. Our scheme could maintain the quality of the reconstructed images
  even when the projection number was reduced to 15. The cell-based experimental results
  demonstrated that the proposed scheme can improve the imaging speed of the current
  FBP-based SRPT scheme by a factor of 9-12 without sacrificing discernible imaging
  details. Conclusion: Our proposed scheme significantly reduces the total acquisition
  time required for SRPT at a speed of one order of magnitude faster than the currently
  used scheme. This significant improvement in imaging speed would potentially promote
  the applicability of SRPT for imaging living organisms.'
