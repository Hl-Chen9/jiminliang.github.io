abstract: Registration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is challenging
  because extracting located identically and unique features on both images are tricky.
  This paper proposes a novel optical and SAR image registration method based on relative
  total variation (RTV) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), named RTV-SIFT,
  to extract feature points on the edges of structures and construct structural edge
  descriptors to improve the registration accuracy. First, a novel RTV-Harris feature
  point detection method by combining the RTV and the multiscale Harris algorithm
  is proposed to extract feature points on both images&rsquo; significant structures.
  This ensures a high repetition rate of the feature points. Second, the feature point
  descriptors are constructed on enhanced phase congruency edge (EPCE), which combines
  the Sobel operator and maximum moment of phase congruency (PC) to extract edges
  from structured images that enhance robustness to nonlinear intensity differences
  and speckle noise. Finally, after coarse registration, the position and orientation
  Euclidean distance (POED) between feature points is utilized to achieve fine feature
  point matching to improve the registration accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate
  the superiority of the proposed RTV-SIFT method in different scenes and image capture
  conditions, indicating its robustness and effectiveness in optical and SAR image
  registration.
