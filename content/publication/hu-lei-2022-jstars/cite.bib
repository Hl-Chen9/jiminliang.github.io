 abstract = {Extracting objects of interest from remote sensing imagery is an essential part in various practical applications. The objects that people pay attention to in the remote sensing scene mainly include buildings, roads, vehicles, etc. In this article, extracting the aforementioned objects are collectively referred to as the target extraction task. Arising from object scale variation, appearance similarity between adjacent patches, diversity of imaging orientation, and complexity of background, it is difficult to extract complete objects from cluttered backgrounds. Deep neural network has made great achievement in dense prediction for target extraction. However, most of the previous works are still faced with a formidable challenge in discriminative context feature representation to extract targets of various categories and correctly classify pixels around the boundary. In this article, we propose a target extraction neural network, named discriminative context-aware network, to focus on discriminative high-level context features and preserve spatial information. First, a discriminative context-aware feature module is designed to generate the feature maps in the top layer, which not only captures the rich image context information but also aggregates the contrasted local information at multiple scales. Second, a refine decoder module is adopted to preserve spatial information from low-level layers and enhance the feature representation, leading to precise segmentation results. We conducted extensive experiments on building and road extraction benchmarks, including WHU building dataset and Massachusetts road dataset, together with a self-constructed dataset for vehicle extraction in SAR images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters and faster inference.},
