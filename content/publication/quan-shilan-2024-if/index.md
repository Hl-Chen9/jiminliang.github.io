abstract: Harnessing the complementarity between the brain and artificial neural networks
  has shown great promise for the development of novel brain–machine fusion systems
  that may rival the robustness and flexibility of the human visual system. Nonetheless,
  due to the requirement of human involvement, brain–machine fusion models are challenging
  to apply in a brain-in-the-loop manner to handle task demands that involve long
  duration, high intensity and complex operating environments. In this paper, we propose
  a brain–machine fusion approach to achieve the brain-in-the-loop modeling and brain-out-of-the-loop
  application. The similarities and differences between the image representations
  of brain responses and image features computed by deep convolutional neural network
  (DCNN) are firstly analyzed using a rhesus monkey dataset, and the results lay the
  foundation for the feasibility of brain–machine fusion. A brain–machine fusion model
  is then developed and a multimodal supervised contrastive learning method is proposed
  to jointly learn the image representations for brain responses and DCNNs. The fusion
  model can be applied in a brain-out-of-the-loop manner, effectively addressing the
  challenges encountered by human-involved approaches. Extensive experiments on a
  self-built human vehicle detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed method in improving the generalization ability of the downstream image
  classifiers, both in cross-modal learning or multimodal fusion settings.
