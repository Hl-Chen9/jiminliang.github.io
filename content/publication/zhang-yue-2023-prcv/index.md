abstract: Muscle atrophy is a widespread disease that can reduce quality of life and
  increase morbidity and mortality. The development of non-invasive method to evaluate
  muscle atrophy is of great practical value. However, obtaining accurate criteria
  for the evaluation of muscle atrophy under non-invasive conditions is extremely
  difficult. This paper proposes a self-supervised temporal ultrasound reconstruction
  method based on masked autoencoder to explore the dynamic process of muscle atrophy.
  A score-position embedding is designed to realize the quantitative evaluation of
  muscle atrophy. Ultrasound images of the hind limb muscle of six macaque monkeys
  were acquired consecutively during 38 days of head-down bed rest experiments. Given
  an ultrasound image sequence, an asymmetric encoder-decoder structure is used to
  reconstruct the randomly masked images for the purpose of modelling the dynamic
  muscle atrophy process. We demonstrate the feasibility of using the position indicator
  as muscle atrophy score, which can be used to predict the degree of muscle atrophy.
  This study achieves the quantitative evaluation of muscle atrophy in the absence
  of accurate evaluation criteria for muscle atrophy.
