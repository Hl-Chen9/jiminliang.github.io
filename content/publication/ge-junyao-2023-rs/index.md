abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an all-weather sensing technology that
  has proven its effectiveness for ship detection. However, detecting ships accurately
  with oriented bounding boxes (OBB) on SAR images is challenging due to arbitrary
  ship orientations and misleading scattering. In this article, we propose a novel
  anchor-free key-point-based detection method, KeyShip, for detecting orientated
  SAR ships with high precision. Our approach uses a shape descriptor to model a ship
  as a combination of three types of key points located at the short-edge centers,
  long-edge centers, and the target center. These key points are detected separately
  and clustered based on predicted shape descriptors to construct the final OBB detection
  results. To address the boundary problem that arises with the shape descriptor representation,
  we propose a soft training target assignment strategy that facilitates successful
  shape descriptor training and implicitly learns the shape information of the targets.
  Our experimental results on three datasets (SSDD, RSDD, and HRSC2016) demonstrate
  our proposed method&rsquo;s high performance and robustness.
