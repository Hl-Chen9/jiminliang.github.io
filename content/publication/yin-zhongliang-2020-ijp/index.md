abstract: Neuronal oscillatory activity has been considered to play a key role in
  face processing through its functional effect on information flow and exchange in
  human brain. Specifically, most neuronal oscillatory activity is measured in different
  rhythm based on the electrophysiological signal at single channel level. Although,
  the neuronal oscillatory coupling between neuronal assembles is associated with
  the information flow and exchange between brain regions, few studies focus on this
  type of neuronal oscillatory activity in face processing. In this study, the neuronal
  oscillatory coupling was investigated based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data
  of 20 participants, which were recorded when the participants were in a face/non-face
  perceptual task. The phase lag index (PLI) was used to assess the neuronal oscillatory
  coupling between brain regions in typical frequency bands. Enhanced short-range
  coupling was observed in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) band over the frontal
  region, in gamma1 (30-49 Hz) band over the left posterior and occipito-temporal
  regions, and in gamma2 (51-75 Hz) over the right temporal region during face perception
  compared with non-face perception. Long-range coupling was increased in theta and
  gamma band over the right hemisphere during face perception. Moreover, increased
  long-range coupling was observed in alpha band over the left and right hemisphere
  respectively during face perception. The results suggested that frequency-specific
  neuronal oscillatory coupling within and between regions of frontal cortex and the
  ventral visual pathway played an important role in face perception, which might
  reflect underlying neural mechanism of face perception.
