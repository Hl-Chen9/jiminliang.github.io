 abstract = {Neuronal oscillatory activity has been considered to play a key role in face processing through its functional effect on information flow and exchange in human brain. Specifically, most neuronal oscillatory activity is measured in different rhythm based on the electrophysiological signal at single channel level. Although, the neuronal oscillatory coupling between neuronal assembles is associated with the information flow and exchange between brain regions, few studies focus on this type of neuronal oscillatory activity in face processing. In this study, the neuronal oscillatory coupling was investigated based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data of 20 participants, which were recorded when the participants were in a face/non-face perceptual task. The phase lag index (PLI) was used to assess the neuronal oscillatory coupling between brain regions in typical frequency bands. Enhanced short-range coupling was observed in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) band over the frontal region, in gamma1 (30-49 Hz) band over the left posterior and occipito-temporal regions, and in gamma2 (51-75 Hz) over the right temporal region during face perception compared with non-face perception. Long-range coupling was increased in theta and gamma band over the right hemisphere during face perception. Moreover, increased long-range coupling was observed in alpha band over the left and right hemisphere respectively during face perception. The results suggested that frequency-specific neuronal oscillatory coupling within and between regions of frontal cortex and the ventral visual pathway played an important role in face perception, which might reflect underlying neural mechanism of face perception.},
