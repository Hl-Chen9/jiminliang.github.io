 abstract = {Objective: Existing methods for muscle atrophy evaluation based on muscle size measures from ultrasound images are inadequate in precision. Radiomics has been widely used in various medical studies, but its validity for the evaluation of muscle atrophy has not been fully explored. Methods: This study presents a radiomics analysis for muscle atrophy evaluation using ultrasound images. The hindlimb unloading rat model was developed to simulate weightlessness muscle atrophy and ultrasound images of the hind limbs were acquired for both the hindlimb unloaded (HU) and control groups during a 21-day HU period. A total of 368 radiomics features were extracted and the stable and informative features were selected through a two-stage feature selection procedure. The feature change trajectory of the stable features was analyzed using the hierarchical clustering method. Finally, an adaptive longitudinal feature selection and grading network, ALNet, was developed to evaluate muscle atrophy. Results: The clustering trajectories of ultrasound image features showed similar trends to the changes in muscle atrophy at the molecular level. The best grading accuracy achieved by the ALNet was 79.5% for the Soleus (Sol) muscle and 82.6% for the Gastrocnemius (Gas) muscle. Conclusion: The test-retest is essential in performing radiomics analysis on ultrasound images. The longitudinal feature selection is important for muscle atrophy grading. The ultrasound image features of the Gas muscle have better discrimination ability than that of the Sol muscle. This study proves for the first time the capability of ultrasound image features for muscle atrophy evaluation.},
