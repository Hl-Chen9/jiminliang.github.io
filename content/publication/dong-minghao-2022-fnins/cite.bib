 abstract = {Visual experience modulates the intensity of evoked brain activity in response to training-related stimuli. Spontaneous fluctuations in the restful brain actively encode previous learning experience. However, few studies have considered how real-world visual experience alters the level of baseline brain activity in the resting state. This study aimed to investigate how short-term real-world visual experience modulates baseline neuronal activity in the resting state using the amplitude of low-frequency (<0.08 Hz) fluctuation (ALFF) and a visual expertise model of radiologists, who possess fine-level visual discrimination skill of homogeneous stimuli. In detail, a group of intern radiologists (n = 32) were recruited. The resting-state fMRI data and the behavioral data regarding their level of visual expertise in radiology and face recognition were collected before and after 1 month of training in the X-ray department in a local hospital. A machine learning analytical method, i.e., support vector machine, was used to identify subtle changes in the level of baseline brain activity. Our method led to a superb classification accuracy of 86.7% between conditions. The brain regions with highest discriminative power were the bilateral cingulate gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus, the bilateral precentral gyrus, the bilateral superior parietal lobule, and the bilateral precuneus. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate baseline neurodynamic alterations in response to real-world visual experience using longitudinal experimental design. These results suggest that real-world visual experience alters the resting-state brain representation in multidimensional neurobehavioral components, which are closely interrelated with high-order cognitive and low-order visual factors, i.e., attention control, working memory, memory, and visual processing. We propose that our findings are likely to help foster new insights into the neural mechanisms of visual expertise.},
