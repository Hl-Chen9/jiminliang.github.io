abstract: Medical image analysis is performed by analyzing images obtained by medical
  imaging systems to solve clinical problems. The purpose is to extract effective
  information and improve the level of clinical diagnosis. In recent years, automatic
  segmentation based on deep learning (DL) methods has been widely used, where a neural
  network can automatically learn image features, which is in sharp contrast with
  the traditional manual learning method. U-net is one of the most important semantic
  segmentation frameworks for a convolutional neural network (CNN). It is widely used
  in the medical image analysis domain for lesion segmentation, anatomical segmentation,
  and classification. The advantage of this network framework is that it can not only
  accurately segment the desired feature target and effectively process and objectively
  evaluate medical images but also help to improve accuracy in the diagnosis by medical
  images. Therefore, this article presents a literature review of medical image segmentation
  based on U-net, focusing on the successful segmentation experience of U-net for
  different lesion regions in six medical imaging systems. Along with the latest advances
  in DL, this article introduces the method of combining the original U-net architecture
  with deep learning and a method for improving the U-net network.
