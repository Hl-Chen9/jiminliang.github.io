abstract: 'Background: The precise assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) is crucial
  both for therapeutic interventions in old MI and the development of new and effective
  techniques to repair injured myocardium. A novel method was developed to assess
  left ventricular (LV) quantitatively infarction through three-dimensional (3D) multimodality
  fusion based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) and technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile
  (99mTc-MIBI) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images. This study
  sought to develop a 3D quantitative method for MI for pre-clinical study and clinical
  application. Methods: Three months after the MI models were established in 20 minipigs,
  CTA and SPECT images were acquired separately, which were then aligned automatically
  with the constraints of the shape and the whole heart and LV myocardium position.
  Infarct ratios were quantified based on the 3D fusion images. The quantitative assessment
  was then experimentally validated via an ex vivo histology analysis using triphenyl-tetrazolium-chloride
  staining and subsequently applied to post-MI patients (n=8). Results: The location
  of an infarct identified by the SPECT was consistent with that identified by an
  ex vivo heart in a 3D space. Infarct size determined by CTA-SPECT was correlated
  with infarct size assessed by triphenyl-tetrazolium-chloride pathology (27.6% [interquartile
  range (IQR) 17.1-34.7%] vs. 24.1% (IQR 14.7-32.5%), r2=0.99, P<0.01). In clinical
  cases, the CTA-SPECT 3D fusion quantitative results were significantly correlated
  with the quantitative perfusion SPECT results (r=0.976, P<0.01). Conclusions: The
  proposed 3D fusion quantitative assessment method provides reliable and intuitive
  evaluations of infarction. This novel quantification technique enables whole heart
  quantification for the pre-operation evaluation and post-diagnosis management of
  old MI patients. It could also be applied to the design of 3D-printed cardiac patches.'
