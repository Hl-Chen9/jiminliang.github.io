abstract: The dual-head positron emission tomography (PET) systems have an importance
  role in the preclinical and clinical applications. This paper focuses on developing
  a simplified model based on distance-driven (DD) and solid angle method to calculate
  the system response matrix (SRM) for the dual-head PET system. The subsampling schemes,
  including the subvoxel scheme and multi-DD scheme were introduced. The full width
  at half maximum (FWHM), coefficient of variation (COV), and contrast were computed
  and compared with that of using the Monte Carlo (MC)-based and multiray methods.
  In this paper, the dual-head PET system is configured with a 5 cm separation and
  52x104 mm^3 detection area of each head. The size of each crystal is 13x1.89x1.89
  mm^3. The results indicate that the rods with 1.0 mm diameter are resolved basically
  with the 100th iteration when the voxel is virtually divided into 2x2x2 and 4x4x4
  subvoxels, which is comparable to that with the MC-based SRM. When the voxel is
  divided into four cuboid-shaped subvoxels, the rods with 1.0 mm diameter are resolved
  with the 80th iteration and the COV performs well in the simulation experiment.
  Overall, the proposed SRM model achieves a good compromise between image quality
  and calculation time.
