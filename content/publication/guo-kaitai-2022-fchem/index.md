abstract: Ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) is a powerful chemical composition analysis
  tool working at atmospheric pressure that can be used to separate complex samples
  and study molecular structures. Resolution is a key parameter for evaluating the
  performance of IMS. However, for the pulsed sampling technique used by drift tube
  IMS, there is an upper limit to the resolution due to the diffusion between ions
  and the drift gas. In this work, an inverse diffusion counterbalance method is proposed
  to break the resolution limit. The method is inspired by the stimulated emission
  depletion (STED). In optical microscopy systems, STED is used to break the optical
  diffraction limit by a ring of depleted light to counteract diffraction effects
  of the excited light. We modified this strategy and applied it to an IMS system
  for counteracting the diffusion effect of the pulsed ion packet. The method can
  increase the resolution up to 1.55 times through theoretical analysis, and the improvement
  is verified by simulations. The simulation results find that the initial width of
  the ion packet has an influence on the effectiveness of the method, and the narrower
  the initial width, the better the effect. The proposed inverse counterbalance strategy
  may also be applied to other spectral analysis instruments to break the resolution
  limit.
