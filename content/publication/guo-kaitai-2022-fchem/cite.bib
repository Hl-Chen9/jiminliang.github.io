 abstract = {Ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) is a powerful chemical composition analysis tool working at atmospheric pressure that can be used to separate complex samples and study molecular structures. Resolution is a key parameter for evaluating the performance of IMS. However, for the pulsed sampling technique used by drift tube IMS, there is an upper limit to the resolution due to the diffusion between ions and the drift gas. In this work, an inverse diffusion counterbalance method is proposed to break the resolution limit. The method is inspired by the stimulated emission depletion (STED). In optical microscopy systems, STED is used to break the optical diffraction limit by a ring of depleted light to counteract diffraction effects of the excited light. We modified this strategy and applied it to an IMS system for counteracting the diffusion effect of the pulsed ion packet. The method can increase the resolution up to 1.55 times through theoretical analysis, and the improvement is verified by simulations. The simulation results find that the initial width of the ion packet has an influence on the effectiveness of the method, and the narrower the initial width, the better the effect. The proposed inverse counterbalance strategy may also be applied to other spectral analysis instruments to break the resolution limit.},
