abstract: A deep neural network for the electromagnetic-thermal co-simulation of microstrip
  patch antenna arrays is proposed based on convolutional encoder–decoder (CED) architecture.
  The proposed network comprises two sub-networks, the gain pattern network and the
  temperature network, which take the antenna array structure and frequency as input,
  and output the gain pattern and temperature distribution respectively. In order
  to improve the performance of temperature network, a novel methodology named multiphysics
  chain-of-thought (MPCoT) is introduced by adding physical reasoning processes similar
  to real physical processes. Training the network utilizes datasets generated via
  the finite element method (FEM) from various array configurations (2 × 2, 3 × 3,
  4 × 4, and 5 × 5), and an off-line training pipeline is designed for the proposed
  network. Leveraging robust approximation capabilities, the proposed network ensures
  both accuracy and a significant reduction in CPU time and memory consumption compared
  to conventional numerical methods when solving electromagnetic-thermal problems.
