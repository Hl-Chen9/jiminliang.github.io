abstract: Radiomics features have been widely used as novel biomarkers in the diagnosis
  of various diseases, but whether radiomics features derived from hematoxylin and
  eosin (H&E) images can evaluate muscle atrophy has not been studied. Therefore,
  this study aims to establish a new biomarker based on H&E images using radiomics
  methods to quantitatively analyze H&E images, which is crucial for improving the
  accuracy of muscle atrophy assessment. Firstly, a weightless muscle atrophy model
  was established by laying macaques in bed, and H&E images of the shank muscle fibers
  of the control and bed rest (BR) macaques were collected. Muscle fibers were accurately
  segmented by designing a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on contrastive
  learning. Then, 77 radiomics features were extracted from the segmented muscle fibers,
  and a stable subset of features was selected through the LASSO method. Finally,
  the correlation between radiomics features and muscle atrophy was analyzed using
  a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The semi-supervised segmentation results
  show that the proposed method had an average Spearmanâ€™s and intra-class correlation
  coefficient (ICC) of 88% and 86% compared to manually extracted features, respectively.
  Radiomics analysis showed that the AUC of the muscle atrophy evaluation model based
  on H&E images was 96.87%. For individual features, GLSZM_SZE outperformed other
  features in terms of AUC (91.5%) and ACC (84.4%). In summary, the feature extraction
  based on the semi-supervised segmentation method is feasible and reliable for subsequent
  radiomics research. Texture features have greater advantages in evaluating muscle
  atrophy compared to other features. This study provides important biomarkers for
  accurate diagnosis of muscle atrophy.
