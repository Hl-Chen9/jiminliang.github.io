abstract: Visual processing refers to the process of perceiving, analyzing, synthesizing,
  manipulating, transforming, and thinking of visual objects. It is modulated by both
  stimulus-driven and goal-directed factors and manifested in neural activities that
  extend from visual cortex to high-level cognitive areas. Extensive body of studies
  have investigated the neural mechanisms of visual object processing using synthetic
  or curated visual stimuli. However, synthetic or curated images generally do not
  accurately reflect the semantic links between objects and their backgrounds, and
  previous studies have not provided answers to the question of how the native background
  affects visual target detection. The current study bridged this gap by constructing
  a stimulus set of natural scenes with two levels of complexity and modulating participants'
  attention to actively or passively attend to the background contents. Behaviorally,
  the decision time was elongated when the background was complex or when the participants'
  attention was distracted from the detection task, and the object detection accuracy
  was decreased when the background was complex. The results of event-related potentials
  (ERP) analysis explicated the effects of scene complexity and attentional state
  on the brain responses in occipital and centro-parietal areas, which were suggested
  to be associated with varied attentional cueing and sensory evidence accumulation
  effects in different experimental conditions. Our results implied that efficient
  visual processing of real-world objects may involve a competition process between
  context and distractors that co-exist in the native background, and extensive attentional
  cues and fine-grained but semantically irrelevant scene information were perhaps
  detrimental to real-world object detection.
