abstract: The Bradbury-Nelson gate (BNG) is a common device used for ion control in
  time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). A dual-location
  control model was employed in order to better understand the behavior of ions around
  a modulated BNG. This model illustrated that the ions are released from the starting
  location and truncated at the cutoff location. The shapes of the starting and cutoff
  locations are both curved with similar curvature, and the cutoff location is situated
  further back. Therefore, the distance between the two locations is a key parameter
  leading to the ion loss during modulation and is influenced by the gating voltage
  difference. Through simulations and experiments, the ion loss is verified to increase
  with the increase in the gating voltage difference. Taking a Fourier transform IMS
  as an example, by reducing the gating voltage difference from 150 to 50 V, the signal-to-noise
  ratio of the time domain result was improved from 91.7 to 386.5 and the resolving
  power was improved from 40.9 to 63.6. In addition, the superposition effect of multicycle
  modulation is shown and explained by the model. When the modulated frequency is
  too rapid and the closing time is insufficient for all the ions to be consumed,
  some ions continue to exist between the two locations, and the residual ions then
  enter the drift region during the next few cycles. This phenomenon needs to be avoided
  because the total number of ions entering the drift region will then increase uncontrollably.
