 abstract = {The Bradbury-Nelson gate (BNG) is a common device used for ion control in time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). A dual-location control model was employed in order to better understand the behavior of ions around a modulated BNG. This model illustrated that the ions are released from the starting location and truncated at the cutoff location. The shapes of the starting and cutoff locations are both curved with similar curvature, and the cutoff location is situated further back. Therefore, the distance between the two locations is a key parameter leading to the ion loss during modulation and is influenced by the gating voltage difference. Through simulations and experiments, the ion loss is verified to increase with the increase in the gating voltage difference. Taking a Fourier transform IMS as an example, by reducing the gating voltage difference from 150 to 50 V, the signal-to-noise ratio of the time domain result was improved from 91.7 to 386.5 and the resolving power was improved from 40.9 to 63.6. In addition, the superposition effect of multicycle modulation is shown and explained by the model. When the modulated frequency is too rapid and the closing time is insufficient for all the ions to be consumed, some ions continue to exist between the two locations, and the residual ions then enter the drift region during the next few cycles. This phenomenon needs to be avoided because the total number of ions entering the drift region will then increase uncontrollably.},
