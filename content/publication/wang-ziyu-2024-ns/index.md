abstract: Task switching refers to a set of cognitive processes involved in shifting
  attention from one task to another. In recent years, researchers have applied transcranial
  direct current stimulation (tDCS) to investigate the causal relationship between
  the parietal cortex and task switching. However, results from available studies
  are highly inconsistent. This may be due to the unclear understanding of the underlying
  mechanisms. Therefore, the current study utilized event-related potential (ERP)
  analysis to investigate the modulatory effects of tDCS on task-switching processes.
  Twenty-four subjects were recruited to perform both predictable and unpredictable
  parity/magnitude tasks under anodal (RA) and sham conditions. The results showed
  no significant changes in behavioral performance. However, marked tDCS-induced ERP
  changes were observed. Specifically, for the predictable task switching, compared
  with the sham condition, the target-N2 component occurred significantly earlier
  for switch trials than repeat trials under the RA condition in males, while no difference
  was found in females. For unpredictable task switching, under the sham condition,
  the P2 peak was significantly larger for switch trials compared with repeat trials,
  whereas this difference was not observed under the RA condition. These results indicated
  the causal relationship between the right parietal cortex and exogenous adjustment
  processes involved in task switching. Moreover, anodal tDCS over the right parietal
  cortex may lead to the manifestation of gender differences.
