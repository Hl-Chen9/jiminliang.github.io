## Multimodal contrastive learning for brain-machine fusion

Harnessing the complementarity between the brain and artificial neural networks has shown great promise for the development of novel brain-machine fusion systems that may rival the robustness and flexibility of the human visual system. Nonetheless, due to the requirement of human involvement, brain-machine fusion models are challenging to apply in a brain-in-the-loop manner to handle task demands that involve long duration, high intensity and complex operating environments. In this paper, we propose a brain-machine fusion approach to achieve the brain-in-the-loop modeling and brain-out-of-the-loop application. The similarities and differences between the image representations of brain responses and image features computed by deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) are firstly analyzed using a rhesus monkey dataset, and the results lay the foundation for the feasibility of brain-machine fusion. A brain-machine fusion model is then developed and a multimodal supervised contrastive learning method is proposed to jointly learn the image representations for brain responses and DCNNs. The fusion model can be applied in a brain-out-of-the-loop manner, effectively addressing the challenges encountered by human-involved approaches. Extensive experiments on a self-built human vehicle detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the generalization ability of the downstream image classifiers, both in cross-modal learning or multimodal fusion settings.
