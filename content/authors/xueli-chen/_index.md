Xueli Chen received his B.Eng. degree in Biomedical Engineering and Ph.D. degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System in 2007 and 2012 respectively. His doctoral dissertation was selected as the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Xidian University. Chen joined Xidian University in 2012 as Assistant Professor in School of Life Science and Technology, promoted to Associate Professor in 2014 and Full Professor in 2017. During 2015 to 2017, he worked as a research postdoctoral fellow at Purdue University (Ji-Xin Cheng's group) on stimulated Raman scattering microscopy. Chen and his team have been constantly at the most forefront of multiscale biomedical photonics imaging in innovation, application, and clinical translation. Professor Chen has co-led the development of Cerenkov luminescence endoscope and further explored the application in early detection of clinical gastrointestinal tumors. Professor Chen has also developed the stimulated Raman projection tomography technology which can perform the volumetric imaging of single cells in a label-free manner. Professor Chen has served as the member of SPIE, OSA, IEEE, and as a committee member of the Branch of Contrast Technology in China Medicinal Biotech Association, the Nuclear Medicine Committee of Shaanxi Cancer Association, and the Shaanxi Society of Biomedical Engineering.

My name in Chinese is 陈雪利.
