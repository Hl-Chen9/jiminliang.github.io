My name in Chinese is 戈浚尧, which corresponds to Junyao Ge in English. I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Electronic Engineering at Xidian University, China. My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and remote sensing.

Upon graduation, I will join Huawei ICT Products & Solutions, where I will work on developing multimodal large language models for networking and security applications.

My Ph.D. thesis title is: "Research on Key Methods for Remote Sensing Image Interpretation Driven by Multimodal Large Language Models." (Its Chinese title is: 多模态大模型驱动的遥感图像解译关键方法研究).
