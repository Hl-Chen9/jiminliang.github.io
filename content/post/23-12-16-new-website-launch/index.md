<!--more-->

## Create the repository

Go to the [template’s GitHub page](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/research-group/) and click Edit.

Then, in the Repository Name field, enter jiminliang.github.io.

## Create the codespace

In the new repository, click Code > Codespaces > Create codespace on main to edit the new website.

## Edit the webpages

## Publish

Click the Git icon in the left sidebar.

Enter a description of the changes in the text box, and click Commit to save the changes to Git.

Then synchronise the changes to your GitHub repository by clicking Sync.

## View website

In the web browser, go to the website’s GitHub repository.

Tell GitHub that you want to use GitHub Pages to host your website by clicking Settings > Pages > Source and then choosing GitHub Actions.

Now head to Actions > Deploy Website > Run workflow and click the Run workflow button to publish the site with GitHub Pages hosting.

GitHub will now build your website - this can take a minute or two.

Once GitHub has built the website, a green tick should appear on the Actions page.
