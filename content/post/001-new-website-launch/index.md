(1) Create the repository

Go to the [template’s GitHub page](https://hugoblox.com/templates/details/research-group/) and click Edit.

Then, in the Repository Name field, enter jiminliang.github.io.

(2) Create the codespace

In the new repository, click Code > Codespaces > Create codespace on main to edit the new website.

(3) Edit the webpages

(4) Publish

Click the Git icon in the left sidebar.

Enter a description of the changes in the text box, and click Commit to save the changes to Git.

Then synchronise the changes to your GitHub repository by clicking Sync.

(5) View website

In the web browser, go to the website’s GitHub repository.

Tell GitHub that you want to use GitHub Pages to host your website by clicking Settings > Pages > Source and then choosing GitHub Actions.

Now head to Actions > Deploy Website > Run workflow and click the Run workflow button to publish the site with GitHub Pages hosting.

GitHub will now build your website - this can take a minute or two.

Once GitHub has built the website, a green tick should appear on the Actions page.
