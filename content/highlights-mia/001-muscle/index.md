**Research background**

Muscle atrophy due to weightlessness is one of the major health problems encountered by astronauts during medium- and long-term space missions. Prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy in weightlessness is an important guarantee for the successful completion of manned space missions, especially for deep space exploration missions, which demands accurate muscle atrophy evaluation models and related technologies. Among the existing imaging modalities, ultrasonography has the advantages of being portable, non-radioactive, and non-invasive, making it more suitable for evaluating muscle atrophy in special environments such as aerospace. In this project, we have developed radiomics analysis and deep learning methods for quantitative muscle atrophy evaluation using ultrasound images. 

The studies were conducted in collaboration with Professor Jianzhong Guo of Shaanxi Normal University and Dr. Xiaoping Chen of the National Key Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center.
