**Research background**

Muscle atrophy due to weightlessness is one of the major health problems encountered by astronauts during medium- and long-term space missions. Prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy in weightlessness is an important guarantee for the successful completion of manned space missions, especially for deep space exploration missions, which demands accurate muscle atrophy evaluation models and related technologies. Among the existing imaging modalities, ultrasonography has the advantages of being portable, non-radioactive, and non-invasive, making it more suitable for evaluating muscle atrophy in special environments such as aerospace. In this project, we have developed radiomics analysis and deep learning methods for quantitative muscle atrophy evaluation using ultrasound images. 

The studies were conducted in collaboration with Professor Jianzhong Guo of Shaanxi Normal University and Dr. Xiaoping Chen of the National Key Laboratory of Human Factors Engineering at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center.

**Ultrasound radiomics for longitudinal evaluation of muscle atrophy** 

This study demonstrates for the first time the capability of radiomics analysis in the evaluation of muscle atrophy using ultrasound images. The stability and informativeness of ultrasound image features were evaluated through a two-stage feature selection procedure. An adaptive longitudinal feature selection and grading network was developed for muscle atrophy evaluation. The results demonstrated the necessity and feasibility of constructing a graded model by fusing multi-stage models in the longitudinal evaluation of muscle atrophy.
